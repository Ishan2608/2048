# 2048 Game Frontend Web Clone

Welcome to the 2048 Game Frontend Web Clone project! This repository hosts a captivating and addictive clone of the famous 2048 puzzle game, built as a web version using modern frontend technologies. In this game, users are challenged to strategically move numbered blocks within a 4x4 grid to achieve the ultimate goal: reaching a total sum of 2048.

# How to Play
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) or swipe gestures (for touch-enabled devices) to move the numbered blocks in the desired direction.
When two blocks with the same number collide, they merge into a single block with their sum.
The game ends when the user successfully reaches a block with a value of 2048 or when the grid is completely filled, and no more valid moves are possible.


# Features

Our 2048 Game Frontend Web Clone comes packed with exciting features to enhance your gaming experience:

<b> Undo (Feature: False) </b>

<b> Score Tracking (Feature: True) </b>
Keep track of your progress with the built-in scoring system. Every time you merge two blocks, your score increases. Challenge yourself to achieve the highest score possible and compete with your friends for the top spot on the leaderboard!
